It's important to note that the _variables mixing file should not be changed directly
as it can and will be overwritten during future updates or installs.
Instead, each variable is marked with a Sass !default keyword.
The !default keyword can be considered the opposite of !important.
This allows us to override the setting easily in our own code external to the _variables file.
